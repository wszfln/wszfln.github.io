<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Yingying Lu and my student number is 20095278, and this is my introduction to my final year project. </p>
<p>Android-based Garbage Sorting and Recycling App
    ———GreenSort: Better sorting and recycling</p>
<p>Project Description</p>
<p>My project is an Android-based mobile application designed to simplify and enhance the waste sorting and recycling process. The application, called GreenSort, provides users with an interactive platform with three functional modules available. In the waste classification knowledge introduction module, users can obtain knowledge about waste management. In the garbage classification query module and garbage collection point positioning module, the program utilizes advanced image recognition and positioning technology to enable users to immediately identify waste categories and find nearby recycling centers, thus contributing to a more sustainable environment. At the same time, the app provides real-time data and a comprehensive database of waste categories, improving recycling accuracy and efficiency. GreenSort's features are available to everyone who needs to sort and recycle waste in Ireland, making recycling easier and more efficient for everyone, aiming to solve the challenge of poor waste management and promote environmentally friendly practices.</p>
